# osu-calc
osu! calc is a performance point(PP) calculator for the game osu! This program only works on standard beatmaps. If provided an API key you will be able to use a link to easily calculate PP without downloading the beatmap. Use keys.cfg to add the API key. Most of this code is based on the C++ version located [here](https://github.com/Francesco149/oppai).

# Usage

This program is written in python and requires version 2.7.

This branch contains my tests for changes to flashlight pp.

Opening gui.py will allow you to pick a map and return current pp and pp with my proposed flashlight change.

Opening profile_gui.py will allow you to recalculate a user's profile with my proposed flashlight changes. To choose a user, change the username in profile_gui.py (I am lazy!!!)
